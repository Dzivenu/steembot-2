# steembot
Simple chrome extension that upvotes contents when you go to steemit.com for you. It helps get as many curation rewards as possible on your favorite social network.

## Getting started

1. Install the extensions either from Google Store or from this repository
2. Right click the extensions and click on 'Options' to configure your bot settings
3. Click the extension icon to activate
4. Open a steemit.com tab (most likely the 'new' one)

The bot will automatically start scrolling and fetching more content, then analyze everything and eventually upvote. Then it will refresh and do it again, and again, and again, and again.
